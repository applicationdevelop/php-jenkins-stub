# Readme for php-jenkins-stub

I've taken these excellent instructions : http://jenkins-php.org/

And this excellent example project : http://github.com/thePHPcc/bankaccount/

Added this excellent BDD tool : https://github.com/olbrich/cuke4php

And made an empty project which can be a basis for future 
apps that need some good testin'.

## Howto

Follow the jenkins-php instructions to get the php-template 
Jenkins project.

Then, you should probably be able to clone this repo to local or
put the github repo directly into jenkins, depending on if you've 
got the Git or the Github plugins installed.

## Required PEAR Packages

	sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
	sudo pear channel-discover components.ez.no
	sudo pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
	sudo pear upgrade pear
	sudo pear install pear.phpqatools.org/phpqatools channel://pear.netpirates.net/phpDox-0.4.0 theseer/Autoload phpunit/PHPUnit

## Required gems

	term-ansicolor rspec webrat builder diff-lcs mechanize gherkin cucumber cuke4php

## Required ports

	php5-xsl php5-iconv php5-sockets

## Config

Make sure Jenkins' git plugin is pointing at the correct git binary if git is not in your path.

Make sure the PEAR directory is in your php.ini's include_path

Make sure that all the php* and pdepend binaries are in your path

## Project Naming

There's loads of things called CHANGEME that you should ... change ...
probably to the name of your app.

### Files

	./features/CHANGEME.feature
	./features/step_definitions/CHANGEME_steps.php
	./src/CHANGEME.php
	./tests/unit/CHANGEMETest.php

### Contents

	phpdox.xml.dist:4: <project name="CHANGEME" source="src" workdir="build/phpdox">
	phpunit.xml.dist:10:    <testsuite name="CHANGEME">
	phpunit.xml.dist:17:    <log type="coverage-html" target="build/coverage" title="CHANGEME"
	src/autoload.php:10:                'changeme' => '/CHANGEME.php'
	src/CHANGEME.php:7:class CHANGEME {
	tests/autoload.php:10:                'changemetests' => '/unit/CHANGEMETest.php'
	tests/unit/CHANGEMETest.php:3:class CHANGEMETests extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
	tests/unit/CHANGEMETest.php:5:	public function testCHANGEME() {
	tests/unit/CHANGEMETest.php:6:		$cm = new CHANGEME();

I'm new to this, but I don't think you need to change the autoload.php
files because they'll be generated by the phpab ant task.

PHPUnit tests will be loaded if the filename ends with Test.php.

## What's Next

Make a script that takes a project name and moves files / changes
things from CHANGEME.
